Bitlocker-1

Description
Jacky is not very knowledgable about the best security passwords and used a simple password to encrypt their BitLocker drive. See if you can break through the encryption! Download the disk image here 

start by first downloading the disk image file that we are provided in the challenege 

then we check which type of file it is by using the file command and once we confirm that it a disk image we proceed with the next steps 

we will first use a bitlocker hash extractor tool named "bitlocker2john"

and using the command below 

"bitlocker2john -i bitlocker-1.dd > bitlocker_hash.txt"

we are calling the tool and "-i" to specify that it is a disk image and then pass the name of the image file 
which in out case ins bitlocker-1.dd and then we add the "> file_name.txt" in which you want the output needs to be stored the name can be anything of your choice

Once that is done now we can see that a new file is found in the directory in my case it will be "bitlocker_hash.txt" and in this file all the hashes that were taken from the disk image will be stored 

Once we have the hashes now we have to brute force the password using a dictionary attack for this we will be using a tool called "hashcat" and since we are going to be using a dictionary attack we will be needing a wordlist and since its a small challenge we can simply use one of the most powerful and commonly used wordlist "rockyou.txt"

then we run this command 

"hashcat -m 22100 -a 0 bitlocker_hash.txt <path_of_rockyou.txt> -w 3"

here we are first calling the tool and then "-m 22100" argument this is used so that it specifies the hash mode for the hashcat to distingush it as a bitlocker hash, then the "-a 0" sets the mode as a dictionary mode attack, then its the hash file that has the text and then followed by the path of the wordlish we are using and the the nfinal argument "-w 3" puts in more workload so that the hashing is more effecient and faster

once that is done the hascat should return the password in this challenge it was "jacqueline"

the next step is to decrypt the bitlocker file using the password see the contents 

now we make a new directory 
Make a directory to store the dislocker-file located inside the bitlocker.dd, a virtual file that represents the decrypted contents of the bitlocker encrypted volume.

this name can be anything 

once that is done run this command 
"sudo dislocker bitlocker-1.dd -ujacqueline dislocker"

this uses a tool called dislocker to unlock the file which was provided for us then we use the -u argument to provide it with the password and then the directory name into which it should decrypt all the contents 

once the decryption is done we move on to the next step which is mounting it 
make another folder in my case i am going to name is "mounted"

using the cmd "mkdir mounted"

then we can simply mount the contents from the decrypted diskc drive to the mounted folder 

using this command to do so 

"sudo mount -o loop dislocker/dislocker-file mounted"

once this is done we can cd to the mounted directory and find the contents of the disk image 

we can see that there is a flag.txt so we "cat flag.txt" to read the file and boom we get the flag
