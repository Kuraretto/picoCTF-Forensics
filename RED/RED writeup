RED 

Description
RED, RED, RED, RED Download the image:

this is a very simple challenge where the flag is hidden in a image 

to find the flag I used the tool called "zsteg"

to use the tool to find the hidden data in the image we can use the code 

zsteg reg.png

this shows us the data hidden in the image, once we run this we can find that text are hidden in the image, some text looks encrypted as well, at a glance the text looks like its encrypted using base64 

so using cyber chef i was able to decode it and get the flag
