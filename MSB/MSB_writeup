MSB

Description
This image passes LSB statistical analysis, but we can't help but think there must be something to the visual artifacts present in this image... Download the image here

download the image provided in the challenge, given the named of the challenge looks like we are dealing with MSB problem 

MSB stands for “most significant bit”, and it is the bit that has the biggest weight, usually the number/bit on the furthest left.

For example, take the number 2500. The most significant bit is “2”, since it has a value of 2000. This time, take the binary number

11011001

The most significant bit in this example is the furthest left bit, which has a value of 128.

How does knowing this help us here? To explain, every 8‑bit color channel in an image (R, G or B) stores values from 0…255. In binary, that’s bits 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0. People often hide important data using the most significant bits of the image.

so we open the using on stegonline

website :- https://georgeom.net/StegOnline/

we upload the file and go to the data extraction 

Since we’re doing this using MSB, let’s select bit 7 for Red, Blue, and Green, because 7 is the most significant bit in the column.

the output only prints the first few bits so download the output, this gives us the entire data hiudden in the image which was around 96000 words 

we open this on notepade and simply using the "find" feature to find the flag using the format "picoCTF{"

doing this we get the challenege flag
