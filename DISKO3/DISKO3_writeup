DISKO 3

Description
Can you find the flag in this disk image? This time, its not as plain as you think it is!

we start but first Extracting the Disk Image 
gunzip disko-3.dd.gz

after extracting we should have "disko-3.dd"

Now we shall analyze the disk layout 
to get the disk layout we use the command 

"fdisk -l disko-3.dd"

using that command we find that There are no explicit partitions, which hints that a filesystem is written directly to the image.

Now we mount the disk image 
using these command below we can mount a disk file 

sudo mkdir /mnt/disko-3
sudo mount -o loop disko-3.dd /mnt/disko-3

Now lets Explore the Mounted Image

ls /mnt/disko-3

after we execute this command we come asscorss a "log" folder let's see what is inside this folder 

ls -l /mnt/disko-3/log

1 file in specific stood out the name was "flag.gz"

let's extract the flag file 

cp /mnt/disko-3/log/flag.gz 
gunzip flag.gz

let's view the contents of the file using the cat cmd

cat flag
